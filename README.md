Hello!
I am learning about Jprofiler and how to profile my code with it.

This is a simple code for profiling tests that

Call a method which adds 2,000,000 random integers into an ArrayList, then a LinkedList and one in a HashTable, then deletes each one from the each method.

It will be profiled in Jprofile to compare the time to run each and learn about specs.
